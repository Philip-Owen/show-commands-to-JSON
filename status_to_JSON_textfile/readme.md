# Reading from a text file

This script reads the contents of `interface_status.txt`, which is just a copy and paste from the cisco command `show interface status`.

Running the command `python3 int_status_text.py` will generate a file named `output.json` containing a JSON data structure built using the data from `interface_status.txt`.
